## Project Desc
Henesys Marketplace is a consumer-to-consumer platform for buying and selling food items that are near expiry. This reduces food waste and builds a “Kampong” spirit of sharing within the community. 
For sellers, this platform allows them to list their items and choose to approve or reject offers from buyers. 
For buyers, they are able to make an offer for a food item and make payment.
