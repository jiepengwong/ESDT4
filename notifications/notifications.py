#there's 2 parts to notifications - one for  1) EMAIL SMTP for payments 2) Regular Notifs 

#For the DB, need to create 3 collections ('tables') in mongoDB 
#1) "Standard Msg"
#2) "Notification mapping" - with the seller id, buyer id.... NEW idea: to map the notif DB to Offer instead so that you can have access to seller and buyer id 
#3) Email SMTP standard email template
